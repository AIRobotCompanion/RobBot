\chapter{Specific Requirements}

\section{External interface requirements}
All input into \& output from software
\subsection{User interface}
ASCII character string in the Text Boxes
\subsection{Hardware interface}
ASCII characters \& numbers one by one
\subsection{Software interface}
Both variable values \& control informations
\subsection{Communication interface}
Software back-end: Database(MySQL commands), Bot(Specific ASCII commands made with RobBot protocols)
\\Hardware back-end: Arduino binary commands+values, serial values from connector device(esp8266 or direct connection from computer)
\\very reliable JDBC connector J connects the database with the software

\section{Specific requirements}
\subsection{Data flow diagram}
Attached
\subsection{Class diagrams}
Attached
\subsection{Sequence diagrams}
Attached
\section{Performance requirements}
The software depends on the compatibility of the java version in the main controller device where the software would be installed.
\\High speed connector technology WiFi \& JDBC

\section{Design constraints}
The design is not completely bugless, as it would be developed in current computer technology, but in future some compatibility issue might come.
\\It can be resolved by version controlling

\section{Software system attributes}
\subsection{Reliability}
The software have to be highly reliable in the sense of users' information \& the task it will be given to.
\subsection{Availibility}
The software have to be available $24\times 7$ \& only one user can access at a time.
\subsection{Security}
In future we'll use mCrypton that is easy to know, but not easy to hack to upload the users' information into the database.
\subsection{Maintainability}
This tast would be done by manager in client side \& by developer team in implementors' side with proper version control.
\section{Other requirements}
Not specified.
